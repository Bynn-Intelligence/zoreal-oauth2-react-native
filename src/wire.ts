/**
 * The wire protocol between this package and the ZOREAL OpenID Provider.
 *
 * VERSIONED: a shipped version keeps working until the provider explicitly
 * refuses it, and when it does, the reason is surfaced verbatim. Both the wire
 * version and the package version travel on every pairing request so a refusal
 * can be precise.
 *
 * Endpoints, all relative to the issuer:
 *
 *   POST /pair                     start a pairing request. Body carries the
 *                                  authorize parameters plus PKCE challenge.
 *                                  Returns { request_id, pair_url, expires_in }
 *                                  or, for prompt=none with a live consented
 *                                  session, { code } immediately.
 *   GET  /pair/:id/status          poll: pending | claimed |
 *                                  approved (with code) | denied | expired |
 *                                  enrolling. Over-polling cancels the request
 *                                  rather than throttling it, so the cadence
 *                                  below is not a suggestion.
 *   GET  /pair/:id/qr.svg          the QR image for the pairing URL, served by
 *                                  the provider so the pairing surface stays
 *                                  changeable at runtime and this package
 *                                  keeps zero dependencies.
 *   POST /token                    the code exchange. Browser-direct mode uses
 *                                  it directly with PKCE and no client secret;
 *                                  auth-code mode leaves it to the RP backend.
